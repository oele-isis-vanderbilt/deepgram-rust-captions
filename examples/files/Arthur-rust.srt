The story of Arthur the rat. Once upon

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,000
a time there was a young rat who

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,460
couldn't make up his mind.

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,055
Whenever the other rats asked him if he

5
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:12,875
would like to come out hunting with them,

6
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:15,750
he would answer in a hoarse voice, I

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,850
don't know. And when they said,

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,490
would you rather stay inside,

9
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,930
he would say yes

10
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:25,085
or no either. He'd always

11
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,725
shake making a choice.

12
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:31,970
[speaker 1]
One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,210
him, Now look here. No one will ever

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,890
care for you if you would carry on

15
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,050
like this. You have no more mind of

16
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,890
your own than a greasy old blade of

17
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,325
grass.

18
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:42,885
The young rat coughed and looked quiet as

19
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:44,185
usual, but said nothing.

20
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:45,305
[speaker 2]
Don't you

21
00:00:45,685 --> 00:00:49,225
think so? Said his aunt, stamping her foot,

22
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:52,220
for she couldn't bear to see the young

23
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,760
rat so cold blooded.

24
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,440
I don't know was all he ever answered.

25
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,525
And then he walked off to think for

26
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:01,825
an hour or more,

27
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:03,825
whether he would stay

28
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,145
in his hole in the ground

29
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:09,040
or go out into the loft.

30
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,060
[speaker 3]
One night, the rats heard a loud noise

31
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,880
in the loft.

32
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,580
It was a very dreary old place. The

33
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,025
roof let the rain come down, come washing

34
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:19,585
in.

35
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:22,605
The beams in the rafters had all rotted

36
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:25,825
through, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.

37
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,530
At last one of the joists gave way

38
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,710
and the beams fell with one edge on

39
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,335
the floor.

40
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,195
The walls shook,

41
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:39,355
the cupola fell off,

42
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:42,775
and all the rat's hair stood on end

43
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:44,300
with fear and horror.

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,180
[speaker 4]
This won't do for any leader.

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,120
We we can't stay cooped up here any

46
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,520
longer. So they sent out scouts to start

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,035
exploring their

48
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:56,315
home. A little later on that evening, the

49
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:58,315
scouts come by and said they'd find an

50
00:01:58,315 --> 00:01:59,855
old fashioned hard farm

51
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:02,830
where there would be room and board for

52
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,750
all of them. The leader gave the order

53
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,830
at once, come new, fallen in. And the

54
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,590
rats crawled out of the hole right away

55
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,190
and stood on the floor in a long

56
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,604
line.

57
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:13,805
[speaker 5]
Just then, the old rat caught sight of

58
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:14,625
young Arthur.

59
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,785
That was the name of the shaker.

60
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:18,865
He wasn't in the line

61
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:19,618
and he wasn't exactly outside it. He stood

62
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:20,250
just growled

63
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,845
the old rat coarsely. 'Of course, you're growled

64
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:28,345
the

65
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:29,945
old rat coarsely.

66
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,345
Of course, you're coming too.

67
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,185
I don't know,

68
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,760
said Arthur calmly.

69
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,100
Why, the idea of it. You don't think

70
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,640
it's safe here anymore,

71
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,680
do you?

72
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,360
[speaker 6]
I'm not certain,

73
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,035
said Arthur, undaunted.

74
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:47,995
Your roof may not fall down yet.

75
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:50,695
Well, said the old rat, she can't wait

76
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:52,760
for us to for you to join us.

77
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,780
Then he turned to the other and shouted,

78
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,540
right about the face, march.

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,860
And the long line marched out

80
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:02,115
to burn while the young rat watched him.

81
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,735
[speaker 7]
I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to

82
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:07,395
himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.

83
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,690
It's so nice and snug here. I guess

84
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,330
I'll go back to my hold under the

85
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,790
log for a while

86
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,870
just to make up my mind.

87
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:20,115
But during the night, there was a big

88
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:23,555
crash. Down came beams, rafters, joists, the whole

89
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:24,055
business.

90
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,770
[speaker 8]
Next morning, it was a foggy day, some

91
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,470
men came to look over the damage.

92
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,690
It seemed odd to them that the old

93
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,465
building was not haunted by rats.

94
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,605
But at last one of them happened to

95
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:36,425
move aboard,

96
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:38,665
and he caught sight of a young rat,

97
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:41,045
quite dead, half in and half out of

98
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:41,705
his hole.

99
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,450
Thus, the shirker got his due and there

100
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,070
was no mourning for him.
