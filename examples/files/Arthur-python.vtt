00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.680
<v Speaker 0>The story of Arthur the rat. Once upon

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 0>a time there was a young rat who

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.460
<v Speaker 0>couldn't make up his mind.

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:10.055
<v Speaker 0>Whenever the other rats asked him if he

00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:12.875
<v Speaker 0>would like to come out hunting with them,

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 0>he would answer in a hoarse voice, I

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 0>don't know. And when they said,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 0>would you rather stay inside,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 0>he would say yes

00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:25.085
<v Speaker 0>or no either. He'd always

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.725
<v Speaker 0>shake making a choice.

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:32.050
<v Speaker 1>One fine day, his aunt Josephine said to

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 1>him, Now look here. No one will ever

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>care for you if you would carry on

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.050
<v Speaker 1>like this. You have no more mind of

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>your own than a greasy old blade of

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.325
<v Speaker 1>grass.

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:42.885
<v Speaker 1>The young rat coughed and looked quiet as

00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:44.185
<v Speaker 1>usual, but said nothing.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:45.305
<v Speaker 2>Don't you

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.225
<v Speaker 2>think so? Said his aunt, stamping her foot,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.220
<v Speaker 2>for she couldn't bear to see the young

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 2>rat so cold blooded.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know was all he ever answered.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.525
<v Speaker 2>And then he walked off to think for

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:01.825
<v Speaker 2>an hour or more,

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:03.825
<v Speaker 2>whether he would stay

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:06.145
<v Speaker 2>in his hole in the ground

00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:09.040
<v Speaker 2>or go out into the loft.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 3>One night, the rats heard a loud noise

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.880
<v Speaker 3>in the loft.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.580
<v Speaker 3>It was a very dreary old place. The

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.025
<v Speaker 3>roof let the rain come down, come washing

00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:19.585
<v Speaker 3>in.

00:01:19.965 --> 00:01:22.605
<v Speaker 3>The beams in the rafters had all rotted

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:25.825
<v Speaker 3>through, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.530
<v Speaker 3>At last one of the joists gave way

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 3>and the beams fell with one edge on

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.335
<v Speaker 3>the floor.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.195
<v Speaker 3>The walls shook,

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:39.355
<v Speaker 3>the cupola fell off,

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:42.775
<v Speaker 3>and all the rat's hair stood on end

00:01:42.775 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 3>with fear and horror.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 4>This won't do for any leader.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 4>We we can't stay cooped up here any

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.520
<v Speaker 4>longer. So they sent out scouts to start

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.035
<v Speaker 4>exploring their

00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:56.315
<v Speaker 4>home. A little later on that evening, the

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:58.315
<v Speaker 4>scouts come by and said they'd find an

00:01:58.315 --> 00:01:59.855
<v Speaker 4>old fashioned hard farm

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:02.830
<v Speaker 4>where there would be room and board for

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.750
<v Speaker 4>all of them. The leader gave the order

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 4>at once, come new, fallen in. And the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.590
<v Speaker 4>rats crawled out of the hole right away

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.190
<v Speaker 4>and stood on the floor in a long

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.605
<v Speaker 4>line.

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:13.805
<v Speaker 5>Just then, the old rat caught sight of

00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:14.625
<v Speaker 5>young Arthur.

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:16.785
<v Speaker 5>That was the name of the shaker.

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:18.865
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't in the line

00:02:19.165 --> 00:02:19.618
<v Speaker 5>and he wasn't exactly outside it. He stood

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 5>just growled

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.845
<v Speaker 5>the old rat coarsely. 'Of course, you're growled

00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:28.505
<v Speaker 5>the old

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:29.945
<v Speaker 5>rat coarsely.

00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:32.345
<v Speaker 5>Of course, you're coming too.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.185
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 5>said Arthur calmly.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 5>Why, the idea of it. You don't think

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.640
<v Speaker 5>it's safe here anymore,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.680
<v Speaker 5>do you?

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.360
<v Speaker 6>I'm not certain,

00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:45.035
<v Speaker 6>said Arthur, undaunted.

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:47.995
<v Speaker 6>Your roof may not fall down yet.

00:02:48.775 --> 00:02:50.695
<v Speaker 6>Well, said the old rat, she can't wait

00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:52.760
<v Speaker 6>for us to for you to join us.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 6>Then he turned to the other and shouted,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.540
<v Speaker 6>right about the face, march.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 6>And the long line marched out

00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:02.115
<v Speaker 6>to burn while the young rat watched him.

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:04.735
<v Speaker 7>I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to

00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:07.395
<v Speaker 7>himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 7>It's so nice and snug here. I guess

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 7>I'll go back to my hold under the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 7>log for a while

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 7>just to make up my mind.

00:03:18.355 --> 00:03:20.115
<v Speaker 7>But during the night, there was a big

00:03:20.115 --> 00:03:23.555
<v Speaker 7>crash. Down came beams, rafters, joists, the whole

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:24.055
<v Speaker 7>business.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.770
<v Speaker 8>Next morning, it was a foggy day, some

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 8>men came to look over the damage.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 8>It seemed odd to them that the old

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.465
<v Speaker 8>building was not haunted by rats.

00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:35.605
<v Speaker 8>But at last one of them happened to

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:36.425
<v Speaker 8>move aboard,

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:38.665
<v Speaker 8>and he caught sight of a young rat,

00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:41.045
<v Speaker 8>quite dead, half in and half out of

00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:41.705
<v Speaker 8>his hole.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.450
<v Speaker 8>Thus, the shirker got his due and there

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.070
<v Speaker 8>was no mourning for him.
